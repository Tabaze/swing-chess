Logic flow of clicking on a position:

if new game:
    set white as current turn:
        if white clicks white piece:
            set validMoves = valid moves for that piece:
                redraw board with valid moves:
                    if user clicks on valid move:
                        move piece (redraw board), reset validMoves, change turn to black, go again
                    if user clicks on other piece:
                        clear validMoves
                        generate new validMoves
                        refresh board
                    if user clicks on opp color || empty:
                        do nothing, remain as current turn
        if white clicks empty or black piece:
            do nothing, remain as white turn
